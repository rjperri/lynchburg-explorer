        For a great forest hike nestled deep within Candlers Mountain look for "A Trail Too far" and the "Spirit Trail". When these two trails are connected with Hydaway Lake Rd, one can have a great small escape from everyday busy life. These trails offer stream crossings, solitude, tree views, and some animal watching. Also, this hike will meander through Liberty University's Disc Golf Course, so be sure to bring a Frisbee. The trail begins at the Camp Hydaway Rd trail-head parking lot, and takes about 2 hours to complete.
